# Cyclistic-Bike-Share Analysis

*This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Portfolio Project*


## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Characters and Teams

- **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
- **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
- **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
- **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## Questions

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Deliverables

1. **A clear statement of the business task**
2. **A description of all data sources used**
3. **Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data**
4. **A summary of your analysis**
5. **Supporting visualizations and key findings**
6. **Your top three recommendations based on your analysis**

## Prepare

You will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. You can choose to work with an entire year of data, or just one quarter of a year. If you are working in Google Sheets, there are some files that might be too large to view. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

## Process

Prepare your data for analysis using the Case Study Roadmap as a guide.

## Analyze

Now that your data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, start putting it to work. Use the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:

1. Import your data.
2. Make columns consistent and merge them into a single dataframe.
3. Clean up and add data to prepare for analysis.
4. Conduct descriptive analysis.
5. Export a summary file for further analysis.

## Share

Create visualizations to share your findings. They should be sophisticated and polished in order to effectively communicate to the executive team.

## Act

Prepare the deliverables Morena asked you to create, including the three top recommendations based on your analysis.
